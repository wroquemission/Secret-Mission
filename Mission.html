                Happy (late) birthday, Rel!
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe that it has been almost exactly a year now since we first met in Izumo. It was my first time transferring to another area in Japan and I had no idea what to expect. What sort of a branch was I in? What sort of work was I expected to do? Who would I serve and teach? Soon after I arrived, however, I met you. All at once, my mind was at peace. I found out then and I still know now that Izumo was a special area. In that ancient, quiet town, the Lord was hard at work―and so were Rel and the missionaries.
            </p>
            <p>
                Though it was only for a few weeks, serving in Izumo shifted the entire course of my mission. It may well have changed my life. I think your experiences in that branch were similarly significant to you. After all, I believe that it was the exact, unique place where you were meant to encounter the Church of Jesus Christ. I am humbled to have been able to step on those sacred grounds―the hallowed location where Christ gained an extraordinary victory. That is, where His Church gained the insurmountable force for good that you are.
            </p>

                If memory does not fail me, the date of that most eminent occasion was close to the middle of last year's May. May is the fifth month of the year, and so I have hidden five lanterns in the little game above. Your birthday is the same as mine, and the month that you made the great commitment of baptism is the same that I committed to serving a mission. Given that you are preparing to serve a mission and that you will likely be the best missionary this church has ever called to serve, please allow me to give you five simple tips―pieces of advice that will hopefully give you a head start and help you to immediately begin changing the lives of those around you.

                <ol>
                    <li>Always keep a prayer in your heart. When you are teaching, serving, walking, biking―even when eating breakfast and tying your shoes―constantly counsel in the Lord. He will give you strength to do the hard things. Believe me, hard things do come.</li>
                    <li>Love first. Success in missionary work is not defined by the exact number of people you find or the baptisms that you have the opportunity to see. If you love the people and you love your God enough to have the faith to act, however, the Lord will permit you to see miracles in any aspect of missionary work.</li>
                    <li>Choose to be humble. You will encounter many things that you do not understand as a missionary. Those might be the language you are called to learn, the rules and standards, or why people do not respond to the message of the Gospel as well as you had hoped. Be humble and patient. Never compare yourself with others. The Lord has His timing.</li>
                    <li>Be obedient. You will find the greatest joy in this work when you are obedient to God's commandments and to the inspired guidance of your leaders. It is true that you are only required to obey directions that are righteous. However, you should have the wisdom and the humility to discern what those are.</li>
                    <li>Find reasons to be happy. In missionary work, as in life, you will have plenty of reasons to complain. Avoid the temptation to do so. Instead, sincere and expressed gratitude for everything that you can be grateful for will lead your soul to greater heights.</li>
                </ol>

                Rel, you are a truly special person. I admire you greatly and I am always cheering you on. In this world, and in the lives of so many of those around you, you are a shining light. You have a talent for making people happy and I am so glad that you have chosen to share your light with us all. You are a true and eternal missionary―before, during, and after your full-time service.
